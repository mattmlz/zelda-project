# Project

## Description
Creation of several musical / visual experiences accessible from a menu whose main theme is the bad guys in the geek culture (lord of the rings, star wars, etc.). The visitor creates each time an item / object in connection with a villain without knowing it, he realizes it during the final exposing the villain and his item.
##### In details
The experiences are interspersed with interactions that allow the visitor to progress.
The goal is to make him guess in what universe he enters by putting clues such as notes of music but also visual.
The overall mood becomes darker as the visitor progresses through the experience.
